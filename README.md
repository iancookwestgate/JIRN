# JIRN - The First Choice of Restaurant Connoisseurs - Menu Application

#### A program that allows users to view restaurants around Portland, select them within their region, and then view their menus & contact information.

#### By **Ian Cook Westgate**, **Robbie Kruszynski**, **Nate Wessels**, and **Jack Collins**.

## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and the Google Maps JavaScript API. A user can submit their city of choice (current functionality only supports Portland, OR) and view a cultivated selection of the best quality restaurants in the displayed map. The restaurants are organized by region and, once clicked, the user is guided to a new page containing contact details and menus displayed across multiple slides for maximum accessibility. From here, the user is armed with the information they need to either order what they like from the restaurant (separate from the website) or to return to the navigation page to explore other options.

The website also offers a sign-up system that, while currently non-functioning, would in the future permit the user to join a JIRN database, the social side of the business, and to encourage repeated usage. This information is displayed and interacted with on the profile page, which shows a photo, biographical information, and lets them review websites through the "Food Diary." The Food Diary is where the user can submit where they have eaten and their thoughts on the food/experience, which is saved on their profile in cards below.
